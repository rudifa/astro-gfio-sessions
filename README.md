## ðŸš€ Quick start

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

```sh
  % npm run fetch # fetch the gongfu dev sessions data and save it to src/data/

  % npm run dev

  % npm run build
  % npm run preview
```

Open the page [localhost:4321](http://localhost:4321/)

For a quick look at fetched data you can run the fetch script as

```sh
  % scripts/fetch-gfio-sessions-data.js
```

NOTE: make sure that you have a local `.env` file containing a valid github access token (otherwise your fetch operation will be rate limited)

```sh
  GITHUB_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_...
```

<h2>Published!</h2>

Now (07.05.2024) the project is published on [netlify](https://astro-gfio-sessions.netlify.app/).

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

The source code of the layouts lives in the [`src/pages/`](src/pages/) subfolder.

At its root, this repository is an [Astro](https://astro.build) publication, that is automatically published by Vercel on commits, to allow browsing the layout templates online.

You can preview the Astro publication by running `npm start` after installing the deps. The publication was generated by running the following command:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- --template basics
```

Inside of the Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```text
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.svg
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Card.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ index.astro
â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
